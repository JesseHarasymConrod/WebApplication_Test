<h3>Controlled Rollout</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When a new update is made available to a large audience of 
clients, the availability of the update can be limited for a specified period of 
time.  By controlling the initial rollout, you can avoid bandwidth and 
server loading issues that might occur.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A controlled rollout limits the number of clients that can 
discover the update for a specified time period.  This time period is set 
on the Update Controller <i>ControlledRolloutHours</i>.  </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When the hosting application is launched, a random number 
between 0 and the number of controlled hours<i> </i>is generated.  This 
number represents the hour after which a new update was published, that this 
client can receive the update.  Statistically, the clients should be evenly 
distributed across the designated controlled rollout period.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When the <i>Update Controller</i> checks for an available 
update, the universal time difference between now and when the update was 
published is calculated.  If the time difference is in the <i>Controlled 
Rollout </i>window, the randomly generated number is checked to see if it is 
less than the time difference.  If so, the update is available, otherwise 
it is not.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The <i>Update Controller</i> property 
<i>EnableControlledRollout</i> must be set to true to enable controlled 
rollouts.  The default value is false.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
