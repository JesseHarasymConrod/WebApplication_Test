<h3>Users</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">An AppLife Server user account provides individualized 
access to the AppLife Server dashboard.  When a user logs into AppLife 
Server, the applications for which they are associated with are displayed on 
their dashboard.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Administrative users can create and edit new User accounts. 
To edit users, navigate to the <i>Users</i> view.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><img border="0" src="../ImagesExt/image164_33.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Users are identified by a <i>Username</i>.  Usernames 
must be a minimum of six characters in length and must be unique.  When 
creating a new user, a valid email address must be provided.  When a user 
is created, an email is immediately sent to the users email address and this 
email contains a temporary auto-generated password. Upon first logon, the user 
will be required to create a new password.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Once the user sets a password, the password is hashed and 
salted before being stored.  It can never be sent in an email or displayed 
on a page.  If the user forgets their password, they can request a new 
password be generated.  When a new password is requested, an email is first 
sent to the user, who must confirm this action.  Only after confirming that 
a new password was requested will the server generate and send a new temporary 
password to the user via email.</p>
