<h4>AppLife Manager Configuration</h4>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This is the default method.  A version stamp is 
recorded, along with the rest of the application configuration information that 
determines application behavior within AppLife Manager.  The version stamp 
is read from the configuration information upon the initiation of an update 
check, and as an update is executed, the version stamp is written using the <a class="topic-link" href="setupdateversion.htm">Set Update Version</a><i> 
</i>update action.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This option is appropriate when your application is 
deployed and maintained exclusively using AppLife Manager.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When AppLife Manager first discovers an application using 
this version method, the local version stamp will be 0.0.0.0.  The first 
update published should target this version and perform actions necessary to 
install the application for the first time, or search the local system for any 
existing installation and extract the correct version stamp. If an application 
is found to already exist, the correct existing version number can be recorded 
in the AppLife Manager configuration using the <a class="topic-link" href="setupdateversion.htm">Set Update Version</a> action.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
