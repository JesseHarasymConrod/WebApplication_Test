<h4>64 Bit Operating Systems</h4>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems have 64 
bit versions.  Special consideration must be given when installing and 
updating software on 64 bit operating systems.  These 64 bit operating 
systems have a 32 bit sub-system for compatibility with 32 bit software.  
AppLife Update provides update authors the ability to specifically target the 
32-bit sub-system registry and file system.  Update authors can also 
explicitly register 32 bit and 64 bit COM assemblies.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Applications built to execute in 64-bit mode will 
automatically integrate with the 64-bit system, and 32-bit applications will 
automatically interact with the 32-bit sub-system.  Installers are not as 
straightforward and care must be taken to ensure applications operate as 
expected when installed on a 64-bit Windows operating system.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">With <i>AppLife Update</i>, any action configured to target 
an x86 sub-system on 64-bit operating systems will also target the equivalent 
location on 32-bit operating systems.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
