<h2>Update Actions</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">AppLife Update Action List updates consist of a list of 
<i>Update Actions</i> that are executed sequentially.  When an update 
author is defining the update process for their software, Update Actions are 
used to modify the current installation on deployed clients.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For most applications, the update process consists of 
adding and replacing assemblies and supporting files.  AppLife Update 
contains a choice of actions that adds and replaces files.  </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In extending applications it is sometimes necessary to 
perform additional actions before or after application assemblies and files are 
replaced.  For example, to add a COM component to your application, you 
will need to place the file, and then register the component on the 
system.  You might also find it necessary to modify a configuration file 
during an update.  AppLife Update contains actions to perform these types 
of actions as well.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Though there are many built-in actions to perform the most 
common updating activities, you might also need to perform a specialized 
action.  To perform application specific custom updating activities AppLife 
Update includes a Custom Action infrastructure that provides the ability to use 
.Net code to implement your own custom update actions.</p>
