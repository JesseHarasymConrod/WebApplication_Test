<h5>Cached Downloads</h5>
<p class="MsoBodyText">An update package is cached as it is being 
downloaded.  When the download is complete, it is available to be 
applied.  If an update was previously downloaded and cached without being 
applied, the update can be applied without asking the Update Controller to 
download the update package again.  From the Update Controller’s 
<i>CurrentUpdate</i> property, an integrator can identify whether the current 
update is already downloaded by referring to the <i>IsDownloaded</i> property.
