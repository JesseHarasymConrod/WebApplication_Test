<h4>Download Verification</h4>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Upon successful download of a discovered update, the 
downloaded file is verified to be intact and that it came from the same 
publisher that supplied the application being updated.  This is 
accomplished using the RSA Crypto Service Provider <i>Sign Data</i> 
functionality.  When a new Update Project (aup) is created using the 
<i>Make Update</i> application, an RSA public-private key pair is created.  
The private key is used to sign the update package after it is built.  The 
public key is placed in the <i>PublicKey</i> property of the Update 
Controller.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When a new update package is created, the resulting file is 
signed using the RSA Crypto Provider and the private key of the update 
project.  The signature of the package is placed in the Director file to be 
provided to the application while downloading an update.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When the hosted application downloads the update package, 
the signature and public key are used to verify that the downloaded file has not 
been changed, and that it came from a source that had the proper private 
key.  If any changes were made to the file, or if the update package had 
been created without the appropriate private key, the verification will fail and 
the update package is discarded.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Note:  This verification process assumes the 
sanctity of the private key.  If a private key is compromised, AppLife 
Update would not be able ensure the update package file originated with the 
original software publisher.</i></p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
