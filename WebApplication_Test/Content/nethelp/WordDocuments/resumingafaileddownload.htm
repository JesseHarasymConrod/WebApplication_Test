<h5>Resuming a Failed Download</h5>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Downloaded update packages are cached to disk during the 
download process.  If your network connection is lost during an update 
download, the next download attempt will resume from where the previous download 
failed.  If an update download was completed, but not applied, the update 
package will be persisted and ready for the next update attempt.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">To specify a preferred folder to download update packages, 
you can set the <i>PreferredDownloadPath</i> property of the Update Controller 
prior to downloading the update.  You must ensure that the designated 
folder exists and that the user performing the update has permissions to write 
to the preferred directory.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
