<h3>Integrating Application Shutdown</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Using AppLife Manager, no direct integration into your 
application source code is required for maintaining the application. By 
integrating an AppLife Update controller into your application, you can ensure 
any shutdown code is properly executed by instantiating an instance of the 
Update Controller and listening for the <i>UpdateStarting</i> event. This option 
is only available for applications created in Microsoft .Net</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">To integrate, reference the 
<i>Kjs.AppLife.Update.Controller.dll</i> into your application. This assembly is 
located in the AppLife Update Install Directory\Public Assemblies folder.  
This assembly can be freely distributed with your applications.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Once referenced, instantiate an instance of the 
<i>UpdateController</i> class and set the <i>ApplicationId</i> property to match 
your application.  The Update Controller instance must be scoped to stay 
instantiated during the life of the application.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The <i>Integrated API </i>configuration property must also 
be checked.  Once you have an Update Controller integrated and the AppLife 
Manager configuration set, the Update Controller will shut down your application 
as an update is started and you can interact with the process by listening to 
the <i>UpdateStarting</i> event.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Note:  Your application can cancel the update by 
setting the </i>UpdateStarting<i> event argument response.  </i><a href="http://www.kineticjump.com/update/apihelp/html/1a0ad0c7-bd5b-0d9e-a11d-2bd173fecbba.htm">See 
the AppLife Update Controller API Documentation</a><i> for more 
information.</i></p>
