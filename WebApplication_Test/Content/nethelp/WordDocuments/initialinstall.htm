<h3>Initial Install</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">There are many ways to deploy your application.  The 
most common method used is an MSI setup program, but just file copying is also a 
method (XCopy deploy).  After your initial install, AppLife Update helps 
you maintain your deployed installation by providing the means to build and 
publish updates that your software downloads and applies.  </p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
