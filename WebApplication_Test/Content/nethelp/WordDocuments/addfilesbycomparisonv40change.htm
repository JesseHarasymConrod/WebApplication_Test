<h3>Add Files by Comparison (v4.0 Change)</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The algorithm used to identify files to include in an 
update using the Add &amp; Replace files by Comparison action has been changed 
in version 4.0.  In earlier versions of AppLife Update, an update build 
folder and data identifying which updates were published in the single update 
project publish location were maintained by the AppLife Update project file 
(aup).  This information, along with the target version list of the update 
being built were used to add or remove files from the file list based on a 
determination that a file must already be on a deployed client targeted by the 
new update.  This analysis allowed for a proper file inclusion list, even 
when the action baseline folder didn’t match the new update’s lowest target 
version.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In version 4.0, the project build folder and update 
location data has been removed from the update project in order to support 
publishing updates to multiple independent update locations.  This change 
affects the Add &amp; Replace files by Comparison algorithm because this project 
information was used to determine the files list.  <i>Because of this, the 
action has been simplified to compare files between the designated baseline and 
current folders, without regard to update version information. </i> For an 
accurate file list, the designated baseline folder contents needs to represent 
the lowest target version of the update being built. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Clicking the <i>Update</i> button will upgrade the action 
to use the replacement action.</p>
