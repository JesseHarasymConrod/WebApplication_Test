<h3>Automatic Update Chaining</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Updates chains are made when the current version must first 
apply one or more updates before the highest available update can be 
applied.  This commonly occurs when dated application installers are used 
to install your application, or when your application is infrequently used.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The default behavior of AppLife Update would result in the 
intermediate update versions being discovered and applied individually.  
You can enable automatic chaining.  When automatic chaining is enabled, all 
available updates are downloaded in a single process, and each update is 
sequentially applied before your application is restarted as the highest 
available version.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">To enable automatic chaining, set the 
<i>EnableAutoChaining</i> property of the Update Controller in your application 
to true.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Non-Chainable 
Updates</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If you publish an update that would not participate 
properly within a chain of updates, you can designate that update as 
non-chainable.  An update that requires the operating system to restart, or 
that might rely on activity that your application performs as it is restarted 
are examples of non-chainable updates.  To designate an update as 
non-chainable, clear the <i>Allow chaining from this update</i> checkbox as your 
update is created.  This value can be modified after the update is built by 
managing published updates.</p>
