AppLife Server and allows for a quick overview of all the applications for which 
the logged on user is involved with, based on their assigned roles.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">From their dashboard, uses can link to the Application View 
for any of their applications by clicking on the View icon <img src="../ImagesExt/image164_1.png" alt="" />.  Drilling into an individual 
Application View provides a look into the published versions for that 
application, as well as access to deployed client information for that 
application.</p>

version is easily identified, as well as the results of all their previously 
applied updates. Executed updates can also be searched.</p>
