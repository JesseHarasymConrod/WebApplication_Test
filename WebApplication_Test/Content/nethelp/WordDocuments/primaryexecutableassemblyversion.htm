<h4>Primary Executable Assembly Version</h4>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For .Net applications that define the installed version 
through the management of their primary executable <i>.Net Assembly Version</i>, 
this version can be used by AppLife Manager.  Using this option provides 
improved accuracy for AppLife Manager, as it uses the authoritative source for 
determining the correct installed version.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When using this versioning style, identifying the correct 
Application Path is critical in identifying the installed version.  For 
applications initially deployed with AppLife Manager, your Application Path 
along with the configured Primary Executable, will be identified in the first 
update.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If AppLife Manager will be used to start maintaining an 
application that has previously been deployed through other means, the usual 
configuration is to use the “*” option for <i>Application Directory</i>, and 
then find the correct installation directory through Update Actions and set the 
directory value during the first update that targets 0.0.0.0.  The 
Application Directory can be set using the <a class="topic-link" href="setapplicationdirectory.htm">Set Application Directory</a> 
action.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
