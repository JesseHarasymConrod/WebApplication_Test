<h4>Add &amp; Replace Files by Comparison</h4>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The <i>Add &amp; Replace Files by Comparison</i> action 
automatically determines the files that need to be added to your update.  
The action accomplishes this by comparing files from a target folder with those 
from a baseline folder. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The process of determining files to include in the update 
is performed while the update package is being built.  Files in the target 
folder that are identical to the baseline folder are skipped, and not added to 
the update. Information on skipped files is written to the build output. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">To include subfolders, check the <i>Include 
subdirectories</i> option.  When subfolders are included, the action will 
operate recursively to analyze each file in the branch for inclusion.  
Folders that are not in the baseline folder but in the target folder are created 
when the update is applied.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Note:  Folder permissions are not analyzed.  
New folders will inherit permissions from their parent on the target 
client.</i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">To use this action, </p>
<p class="C1HNumber" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; tab-stops: 198.0pt">1.  
Prepare a baseline folder that represents a snapshot of the deployed application 
directory. This baseline should represent the lowest possible application 
version that this update can target.</p>
<p class="C1HNumber" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; tab-stops: 198.0pt">2.  
Prepare a current folder that represents your application directory <i>after</i> 
this update is applied.  This folder is commonly an output of an automated 
process.</p>
<p class="C1HNumber" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; tab-stops: 198.0pt">3.  Set up 
the action in <i>Make Update</i> to reference these folders.</p>
<p class="C1HNumber" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; tab-stops: 198.0pt">4.  Build 
updates.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i></i> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Prepare Stage</i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">During the prepare stage, this action verifies permissions 
to the target folder.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Execute Stage</i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Makes a copy of the files that are going to be replaced on 
the client computer, then adds and replaces the defined list of files on the 
client.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Cleanup Stage</i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Removes the backup copies that were made during the prepare 
stage.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Rollback Stage</i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Attempts to copy the files that were backed up in the 
execute stage back to their original location.</p>
