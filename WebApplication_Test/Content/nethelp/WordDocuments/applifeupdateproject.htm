<h4>AppLife Update Project</h4>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The AppLife <i>Make Update</i> application can be used to 
define a list of actions that are to be executed on a client computer in order 
to update your software from one version to another.  Actions such as 
replacing files, modifying registry keys, and registering COM components can be 
configured in a sequential manner to update your software.  These actions 
are designed to address the most common update steps required for .Net 
applications.  In addition each action is architected to ensure a complete 
rollback should any update action fail.  This prevents the client software 
from being placed in a comprised condition.  If the built in actions are 
not sufficient to update your software, you can easily create custom actions 
using any .Net language.  Your actions can then be added the list of 
actions to be executed when your software is updated.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
