<h4>Patch Folder</h4>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The <i>Patch Folder</i> action allows you to compare all 
files in a folder with a baseline folder and generate a delta file for each, as 
an update is being created.  Then utilize the delta file, along with the 
existing file to re-create the new file on deployed systems.  This action 
utilizes the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms811406.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Delta Compression API</a> to generate the patch file, 
and re-create the new file starting from the existing file.  Update size 
can be significantly reduced by using this action.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Prepare Stage</i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">During the prepare stage, this action verifies permissions 
to the target folder.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Execute Stage</i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">During the execute stage, the original existing files are 
backed up in case the update must be rolled back.  The action then uses the 
patches and applies them to the existing files.  After a patch is applied, 
the hash of the resulting file is compared to the hash of the target file that 
was taken when the update was created.  If any of the resulting file hashes 
do not match, the action fails and a rollback is initiated.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Cleanup Stage</i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Removes the backup copies that were made during the execute 
stage.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Rollback Stage</i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Replaces all target files with the original back up created 
prior to performing the <i>Execute</i> stage.</p>
