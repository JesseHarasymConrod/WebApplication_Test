<h2>The Make Update Window</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Make Update Window allows you to add and configure 
actions that will be built into your next update.  There are three panels 
within the Make Update Window.  The Actions Palette, the Action list, and 
the Action Editor panel.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Adding an Action</b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">You can select an action from the Action Palette by 
clicking on an action or drag and drop onto the Actions list.  When you 
click an action, the action is added to the Action list below the currently 
selected action in the list.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Manipulating Actions in the list</b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><img src="../ImagesExt/image133_2.png" alt="" /></b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Actions in the list can be selected individually or in a 
multi-action selection.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Actions in the list can be dragged and dropped up and down 
the list.  The action list toolbar has Up/Down command buttons.  The 
Up/Down command buttons are enabled when the selected action(s) are 
contiguous.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Actions can be cut/copied/pasted individually or as a 
multi-action selection.  When actions are pasted, they are added below the 
currently selected action in the list.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Actions can be deleted individually or as a multi-action 
selection.  You are prompted before an action is deleted.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Actions can be checked for inclusion in the built update or 
unchecked for exclusion.  Actions that are excluded are not included in the 
build process.  They are treated as if they do not exist in the update.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Valid Action Indication</b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Whether an action in the list is valid or not is visually 
indicated in the Action list.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><img src="../ImagesExt/image133_3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The icon displayed included a tooltip to indicate what 
validation rule is currently broken.  The update cannot be built until all 
the actions in the list are valid.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Editing Individual Actions</b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Actions are configured through the Action Editor.  
When an action is selected in the Action list, its editor is placed in the 
Action Editor panel for configuration.  Custom actions use a property grid 
for editing their properties.  You can <a class="topic-link" href="customactionbuilder.htm">implement your own editors</a> for your custom 
actions.</p>
