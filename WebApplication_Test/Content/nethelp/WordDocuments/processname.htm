<h4>Process Name</h4>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Enter the name of the application process.  This is 
the process that will be stopped before an update is applied.  If the 
process is running (under any Windows User) while an update is launched, users 
running the process will be prompted to stop the program by the AppLife Manager 
UI. The user will have an opportunity to cancel the update process.  If the 
update is cancelled, the application update process is not stopped and no 
processes will be stopped.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If a user response is not provided within five minutes, the 
update will proceed and the application process(s) will be stopped.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If the process is stopped by the update, it will be 
restarted under any user it was previously running under after the update 
completes.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Note: Application shutdown can be tightly integrated 
using the AppLife Update API.  See </i><a class="topic-link" href="integratingapplicationshutdown.htm">Integrating Application 
Shutdown</a><i> for more information.</i></p>
